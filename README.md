# __MOTORCODE__

**Source code for controlling two Hoverboard motors using an Arduino Uno/Mega and a DS600 RC Module**

***

This project makes use of an Arduino Uno R3 or an Arduino Mega 2560 to control two hoverboard motors by receiving signals from a remote control module, preferably the 6-channel DS-600 RC module.

The libraries used for the project are the hoverboard library, which handles the motor's motion, and the RClib library which translates the signals from the RC module.
